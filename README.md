Flower Prediction using Flask and Machine Learning
This project implements a flower prediction system using Flask for the web framework and Machine Learning (ML) for predicting flower species based on features such as petal and sepal length and width. The model leverages scikit-learn to train on a dataset (such as the famous Iris dataset) and makes predictions on new data via a simple web interface.

Key Features:
Flask Web App: A user-friendly interface to input flower measurements and predict the species.
Machine Learning Model: Uses a classification model (e.g., Random Forest or SVM) to predict the flower species based on input features.
Real-time Predictions: Provides instant predictions with user inputs.
Iris Dataset: Trained on the Iris dataset to recognize three species of flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Flask: Lightweight web framework for creating the app.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
HTML/CSS: For creating the web interface.
How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask application: python app.py.
Access the app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
